Solutions to Advent of Code 2019

## Usage
Run with the command
`swift run Day##`

and replace the `##` with the day to run between `01` and `25`

## Tests
Each day is an executable so in order to enable testing each day has a `Day##Lib` that it uses.
This lib does the work and is used in order to be importable by the test targets so they are able to run.
